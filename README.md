# GoWiki

GoWiki is a project branched from [the eponymous Go tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/),
which is fantastic for beginners.

It is an exercise in implementing a server using [net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/),
organizing and structuring a web-based Go project, and leveraging Go features
whenever possible.

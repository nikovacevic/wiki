# wiki

wiki is a continuation of
[Go's wiki tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/), which is a
fantastic project for beginners.

It is an exercise in implementing a server using
[net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/), organizing and structuring
a Go project, and becoming more familiar with Go syntax and features. In
the long-term, it should present challenges such as dependency management
and implementation of modular design patterns.

# wiki

wiki is a continuation of [Go's wiki tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/),
which is a fantastic project for beginners.

It is an exercise in implementing a server using [net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/),
organizing and structuring a Go project, and becoming more familiar with Go syntax and features.
